This was due to one of the nine Merlin engines shutting down during the launch, and NASA declining a second reignition, as per ISS visiting vehicle safety rules, the primary payload owner is contractually allowed to decline a second reignition. NASA stated that this was because SpaceX could not guarantee a high enough likelihood of the second stage completing the second burn successfully which was required to avoid any risk of secondary payload's collision with the ISS.[26][27][28]\n\n\n5\n\n1 March 2013,15:10\n\nF9 v1.0[7]B0007.1[8]\n\nCCAFS,SLC-40\n\nSpaceX CRS-2[22](Dragon C104)\n\n4,877\u00a0kg (10,752\u00a0lb)\n\nLEO (ISS)\n\nNASA (CRS)\n\nSuccess\n\nNo attempt\n\n\nLast launch of the original Falcon 9 v1.0 launch vehicle, first use of the unpressurized trunk section of Dragon.[29]\n\n\n6\n\n29 September 2013,16:00[30]\n\nF9 v1.1[7]B1003[8]\n\nVAFB,SLC-4E\n\nCASSIOPE[22][31]\n\n500\u00a0kg (1,100\u00a0lb)\n\nPolar orbit LEO\n\nMDA\n\nSuccess[30]\n\nUncontrolled(ocean)[d]\n\n\nFirst commercial mission with a private customer, first launch from Vandenberg, and demonstration flight of Falcon 9 v1.1 with an improved 13-tonne to LEO capacity.[29] After separation from the second stage carrying Canadian commercial and scientific satellites, the first stage booster performed a controlled reentry,[32] and an ocean touchdown test for the first time. This provided good test data, even though the booster started rolling as it neared the ocean, leading to the shutdown of the central engine as the roll depleted it of fuel, resulting in a hard impact with the ocean.[30] This was the first known attempt of a rocket engine being lit to perform a supersonic retro propulsion, and allowed SpaceX to enter a public-private partnership with NASA and its Mars entry, descent, and landing technologies research projects.[33] (more details below)\n\n\n7\n\n3 December 2013,22:41[34]\n\nF9 v1.1B1004\n\nCCAFS,SLC-40\n\nSES-8[22][35][36]\n\n3,170\u00a0kg (6,990\u00a0lb)\n\nGTO\n\nSES\n\nSuccess[37]\n\nNo attempt[38]\n\n\nFirst Geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) launch for Falcon 9,[35] and first successful reignition of the second stage.[39] SES-8 was inserted into a Super-Synchronous Transfer Orbit of 79,341\u00a0km (49,300\u00a0mi) in apogee with an inclination of 20.55\u00b0 to the equator.\n\n\n\nFlight No.\n\nDate andtime (UTC)\n\nVersion,Booster[b]\n\nLaunch site\n\nPayload[c]\n\nPayload mass\n\nOrbit\n\nCustomer\n\nLaunchoutcome\n\nBoosterlanding\n\n\n8\n\n6 January 2014,22:06[41]\n\nF9 v1.1\n\nCCAFS,SLC-40\n\nThaicom 6[22]\n\n3,325\u00a0kg (7,330\u00a0lb)\n\nGTO\n\nThaicom\n\nSuccess[42]\n\nNo attempt[43]\n\n\nThe Thai communication satellite was the second GTO launch for Falcon 9.
